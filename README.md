# Bluetooth-Proximity-Scanner

This script scans for the configured bluetooth MAC adress. If it finds it nearby it does an authentication to verify that it is the correct device. 
The script keeps scanning for the device. When it is disconnected it starts scanning in quicker intervals and again requires authentication to classify the device as nearby.
